## 📌 Sprint & Scrum Notes
- **Sprint Goal Alignment**: Focus on infrastructure setup and first Kafka Producer module.
- **Definition of Done Check**: Environment setup and Kafka base completed; Producer module partially meets DoD.
- **Blockers / Critical Issues**: Waiting for cloud credentials from the Client.
- **Backlog Grooming Outcome**: “AI Consumer Integration” moved to tomorrow.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: End-of-day report sent to the Client.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- “4+1+4” schedule fits well with team energy levels.
- Multicultural team boosts creativity and adaptability.
- Q&A right after stand-up prevents blockers from snowballing.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Implement Event Consumer module with Microsoft Phi AI logic.
- Conduct end-to-end Producer–Consumer testing.
- Prepare interim demo for the Client.
