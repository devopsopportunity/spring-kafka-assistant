# 📅 Daily Timesheet – Spring + Kafka + Microsoft Phi AI Demo Project
**Scrum Framework** – Day 2 (Client: Non-disclosed – Corporate Stakeholder)

## Narrative Context
**2 – Continuation…**  
Work resumes exactly where we left off yesterday.  
**Objective of the day**: complete the **Environment Setup** and start the first **Event Producer Module** in Spring Boot connected to Kafka, with a focus on future integration of Microsoft Phi AI.  

In Scrum, we do not make “fortune-teller” predictions. Instead, the team defines priorities based on the Sprint Goal, re-prioritizes remaining work, and ensures that all deliverables for the day meet the **Definition of Done**.

## 📌 Sprint & Scrum Notes
- **Sprint Goal Alignment**: Complete environment setup and implement the first Producer in Spring Boot.
- **Definition of Done Check**: Environment 100% completed; Producer module in mid-development state.
- **Blockers / Critical Issues**: Awaiting Client confirmation for cloud configuration.
- **Backlog Grooming Outcome**: “AI Consumer Integration” confirmed for Day-3.
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Mid-sprint report sent to Client at the end of the day.

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Importance of starting the day with a clear backlog to reduce friction.
- Environment setup requires extra buffer time to avoid slowdowns in later stages.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Finalize Producer implementation.
- Start Consumer development with Microsoft Phi AI.
- Perform end-to-end Producer–Consumer testing.
