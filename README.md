üìÖ Daily Timesheet ‚Äì Spring + Kafka + Microsoft Phi AI Demo Project
Scrum Framework ‚Äì Day 0 (Client: Non-disclosed ‚Äì corporate level)

Narrative context:
Today, after many months of unpaid downtime and limited project flow, our team has been commissioned by a renowned Client operating in the Corporate World to deliver a new high-impact solution. The engagement followed an initial first discussion call ‚Äî what HR departments like to label as the ‚Äúfirst touchpoint‚Äù ‚Äî and culminated in a face-to-face business lunch. During this lunch, we finalized the agreement, aligned on strategic goals, and set the stage for the delivery phase under Scrum methodology.
