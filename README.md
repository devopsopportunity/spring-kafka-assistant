# Spring-Kafka-Phi3 AI Demo Project

**Description:**  
An integrated demo using **Spring Boot**, **Apache Kafka**, and **Microsoft Phi-3** (via Ollama) for real-time event processing, following the **Scrum** framework for project management.

## 🎯 Goal
Build an end-to-end pipeline:  
Spring Boot Producer → Kafka Topic → Spring Boot Consumer → AI Phi-3 → Processed Response.
